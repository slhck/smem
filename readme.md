# smem

Slhck:

 * bugfix for "list index out of range" and getcolumns() call

GdH:

 * added support for *proc/pid/smaps_rollup* (big speed boost for nonmapping part)
 * added *SwapPss, RssAnon, RssFile, RssShmem, PssAnon, PssFile, PssShmem, AvgVss* columns when supported by kernel
 * added *TPss* column = *Pss* + *SwapPss*
 * added *Name* column (process name *comm*) to process view
 * added *-g*/*--groupcmd* group by command view - same executables grouped together
 * added *-b*/*--basename* option: show only name of executables instead of path / full command with aeguments
 * added physical RAM size detection via *dmidecode* in system overview
 * added *-P* process filter can filter by *PID* and name (comm)
 * added *-T/--totalsonly* print totals only
 * added *-i/--ignorecase* option for case insensitive search
 * added *-W/--sysdetail* option with more detailed view on system memory
 * added */dev/zero* mapping summary - memory initialized from /dev/zero can be (wrongly) included as backed by file to *Mapped* measurement in /proc/meminfo. That should be treated as anonymous memory and therefore it is now subtracted from the *Mapped* measurement in smem system view as *Mapped* is used to interpret cached part of the memory consumed by the processes.
 * added warnings about missing kernel features
 * added *-q/--quiet* option to mute warnings
 * added *-c/--columns* option accept "all" string to use all available columns and *+column_name ...* to add columns to default set
 * added *--pid* option to show process memory based on one pid
 * excluded own process from *-P* filtered output
 * fixed -M filter
 * fixed -R option not accepting argument
 * fixed -K option - kernel compression detection
 * fixed AVGUSS - KeyError: 'uss'

    smem is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux systems. Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional
    set size (PSS), which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used by libraries and applications in a virtual
    memory system.

**I did not make this software, I merely edited it for Python 3 compatibility**

[smem](http://www.selenic.com/smem/) is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux systems. Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size (PSS), which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used by libraries and applications in a virtual memory system.

Because large portions of physical memory are typically shared among multiple applications, the standard measure of memory usage known as resident set size (RSS) will significantly overestimate memory usage. PSS instead measures each application's "fair share" of each shared area to give a realistic measure.

smem has many features:

 * system overview listing
 * listings by process, mapping, user
 * filtering by process, mapping, or user
 * configurable columns from multiple data sources
 * configurable output units and percentages
 * configurable headers and totals
 * reading live data from /proc
 * lightweight capture tool for embedded systems

smem has a few requirements:

 * a reasonably modern kernel (> 2.6.27 or so)
 * a reasonably recent version of Python (3.6 or so)
